# SFML-Box2D-Concept-DEMO
Demo I made as a test(code to expand on) updating code I found on forums for using SFML and Box2D libraries together. Main point was trying to get a working program (objects that collide, and can be managed without error). The physics are off, but it wasn't my concern.

Just another weekend project. Play to learn.
